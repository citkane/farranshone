      <h1>Farranshone Local Planning Steering Group</h1>
      <p>
        This group is concerned with the current and ongoing urban planning
        matters affecting our neighbourhood in Limerick City, Ireland.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div id="content">
      <p>
        We are all verifiably local residents.<br />
        As a group, we are engaging in dialogue with our Metro North
        Councillors.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are attempting to actively dialogue with Limerick Active Travel on
        behalf of our neighbourhood.
      </p>
      <p>
        We want to advance sustainable and progressive urban planning for all
        our streets.<br />
        We want to prevent the improvement of one street from disadvantaging
        others.
      </p>

      <h3>The neighbourhood</h3>
      <p>
        We regard our neighbourhood to be the roughly 500 residences bounded by:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Ennis Rd,</li>
        <li>Shelbourne Rd,</li>
        <li>High Rd,</li>
        <li>Bellefield Trc and</li>
        <li>Bellefield Gdns</li>
        <br />including;<br /><br />
        <li>Rockspring and Shelbourne Gardens.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Your locality may not technically be named "Farranshone", but we are
        using this name for convenience as it is the most central to the
        affected area.

        You may not have seen this before, or nobody called to your door at the
        time.<br />We went to as many doors as possible in the very short time
        period we had available during the consultation.
