      <h1>Farranshone Local Planning Steering Group</h1>
      <p>
        This group is concerned with the current and ongoing urban planning
        matters affecting our neighbourhood in Limerick City, Ireland.
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      We are local residents who, as a group, are engaging in dialogue with our
      Metro North Councillors.
    </p>
    <p>
      We continue to attempt to actively dialogue with Limerick Active Travel on
      behalf of our neighbourhood to advance orderly and progressive urban
      planning.
    </p>
    <p>
      We regard our neighbourhood to be the roughly 500 residences bounded by
      Ennis Rd, Shelbourne Rd, High Rd, Bellefield Trc and Bellefield Gdns
      including Rockspring and Shelbourne Gardens. We apologise if your locality
      is not technically named "Farranshone", but this is used for convenience
      as the most central name to cover the area affected by current planning
      matters.
    </p>
    <h3>We are:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Amanda Ross Gorey</li>

      <li>Gillian Jonker</li>
      <li>Martina O'Connor</li>
      <li>Michael Jonker</li>
    </ul>

      Apologies if you have not seen it, or nobody called to your door. We went
      to as many doors as possible in the very short time period we had
      available during the consultation. It is never too late to agree, sign it
      and send it to our
