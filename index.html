      <h1>Farranshone Local Planning Steering Group</h1>
      <p>
        This group is concerned with the current and ongoing urban planning
        matters affecting our neighbourhood in Limerick City, Ireland.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div id="content">
      <p>
        We are all verifiably local residents.<br />
        As a group, we are engaging in dialogue with our Metro North
        Councillors.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are attempting to actively dialogue with Limerick Active Travel on
        behalf of our neighbourhood.
      </p>
      <p>
        We want to advance sustainable and progressive urban planning for all
        our streets.<br />
        We want to prevent damage to any neighbourhood street as a price for the
        improvement of another.
      </p>

      <h3 id="neighbourhood">The neighbourhood</h3>
      <p>
        We regard our neighbourhood to be the roughly 500 residences bounded
        within:

      <ul>
        <li>Ennis Rd,</li>
        <li>Shelbourne Rd,</li>

        <br />including;<br /><br />
        <li>Rockspring and Shelbourne Gardens.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Your locality may not technically be named "Farranshone", but we are
        using this name for convenience as it is the most central to the
        affected area.
