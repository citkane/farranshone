      <h1>Farranshone Local Planning Steering Group</h1>
      <p>
        This group is concerned with the current and ongoing urban planning
        matters affecting our neighbourhood in Limerick City, Ireland.
      </p>

      <p>
        We are local residents who, as a group, are engaging in dialogue with
        our Metro North Councillors.
      </p>
      <p>
        We continue to attempt to actively dialogue with Limerick Active Travel
        on behalf of our neighbourhood to advance inclusive and progressive
        urban planning.
      </p>
      <p>
        We regard our neighbourhood to be the roughly 500 residences bounded by
        Ennis Rd, Shelbourne Rd, High Rd, Bellefield Trc and Bellefield Gdns
        including Rockspring and Shelbourne Gardens. Your locality may not
        technically be named "Farranshone", but we are using this for
        convenience as the most central name to cover the area affected by
        current planning matters.

      <h3>About us</h3>
      <p>
        This group was formed around a consensus of how we would like our
        neighbourhood to be planned and developed. You can

        You may not have seen this, or nobody called to your door. We went to as
        many doors as possible in the very short time period we had available
        during the consultation. It is never too late for you to agree, sign it
        and send it to our
