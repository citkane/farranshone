    <h1>Farranshone Local Planning Steering Group</h1>
    <p>
      This group is concerned with the current and ongoing urban planning
      matters affecting our neighbourhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are all local residents, and actively engaged in dialogue with our
      Metro North Councillors.
    </p>
    <p>
      We continue to attempt to actively dialogue with Limerick Active Travel on
      behalf of our neighbourhood to advance orderly and progressive urban
      planning.
    </p>
    <p>
      We regard our neighbourhood to be the roughly 500 residences bounded by
      Ennis Rd, Shelbourne Rd, High Rd, Bellefield Trc and Bellefield Gdns
      including Rockspring and Shelbourne Gardens
    </p>
    <p>
      We apologise if your locality is not technically named "Farranshone", but
      this is used for convenience as the most central name to cover the area
      affected by current planning matters.
    </p>
